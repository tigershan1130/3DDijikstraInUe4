# 3DDijikstraInUe4
3D Dijikstra Demo in UE4

Points are baked in cube box manner
You are allowed to click a start point and end point
Able to compute Dijistra path

We can modify this to bake points into 3D space.
We can have spline interpolation between path points to make smoother movement for object traveling inside 3D space.
